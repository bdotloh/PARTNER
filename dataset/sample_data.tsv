Help. Help me. I dunno what I'm doing anymore	That's pretty vague, do you not know what you're doing in regards to a specific section of your life? Like school or work?
I'm done saying I love you to her because I don't want to hear a lie back to me. I feel so ugly and unwanted and unloved	idk what a Red pill means exactly but my advice to you is if she treating you right then fuck her there are billions of other girls out there.
Always feel like I'm being criticized and mocked even when alone.... Does anyone else experience this?	I think it's social anxiety , that creates paranoid feelings , unless I'm wrong but that's how I feel
My diet becomes fucked when i get depressed.. I can't control myself in the grocery store when I'm feeling down. Chips, cookies, soda, cake, you name It. Anyone else a stress eater?	By any chance do you think you're in a loop. Junk food can make you depressed. And being depressed probably makes you eat more junk food? For a while that was my problem too.
I hate not knowing why. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was 14. That's almost 4 years ago and I still don't know why I am like this.	depression. not sadness which is caused by something and is healthy. The best things you can do for depression is first of all, not hiding it, tell your loved ones so they can help you. also get a therapist, very helpful and help you cope with depression and get over it.
